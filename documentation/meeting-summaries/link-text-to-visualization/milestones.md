##Milestones for project

* M1: (week 1): Fix bug with shape of the squares and ellipses, fitting the text appropriately. Add the visualization of executions
* M2: (week 2-3): When you hover over a link, highlight the step in the visualization. A simple highlight would be enough (mininimum functionality)
* M3: (week 4-5): Focus visualization: when hovering over a component in the text, it is highlighted and focused appropriately in the visualization.
* M4: (week 6-7): When selecting a workflow component, highlight in the text the elements that refer to it.
* M5: (week 7-9): Tool tip with additional information when selecting a workflow component (optional)

* Demos should be ready for our weekly meetings. The demos should be able to run in my computer too.
