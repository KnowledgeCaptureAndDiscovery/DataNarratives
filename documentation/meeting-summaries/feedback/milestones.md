##Milestones for project

* M1: (week 1): getting familiar with the Polymer framework, create hello world example.
* M2: (week 2-3): Be able to display narratives from a JSON file. When clicking on the narratives, a panel on the right side should show the edit view, although the buttons may not do anything at this stage.
* M3: (week 3-4): Make edit functionality of links work. This means that when a label is edited, the change should be saved in disk according to the JSON-LD metadata representation.
* M4: (week 5-6): Show edit history. We have agreed that the parent root for all edits will be the original narrative.
* M5: (week 7-9): Do edit ++functionality. This means be able to expand on details, querying the current endpoint.

Other features discussed:

* No access control will be implemented
* Narratives should have a copy button
* Demos should be ready for our weekly meetings. The demos should be able to run in my computer too.
